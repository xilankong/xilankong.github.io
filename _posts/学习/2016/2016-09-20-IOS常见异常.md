IOS 异常捕获和常见Crash

1."performSelector may cause a leak because its selector is unknown"

cause by 

```
[target performSelector:action];
```

solve 

```
IMP imp = [target methodForSelector:action];
void (*func)(id, SEL) = (void *)imp;
func(target,action);
```

或者忽略

```
#pragma clang diagnostic push
#pragma clang diagnostic ignored "-Warc-performSelector-leaks"
[target performSelector:action];
#pragma clang diagnostic pop
```
